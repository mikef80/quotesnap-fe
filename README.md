# Quotes Snap

QuoteSnap is an app for Android devices that allows users to take a photo of any inspirational text they see. The app will then use OCR technology to recognise and extract the text. 

The user can then crop the photo to ensure only the text they want is scanned. Finally, the user can add additional details regarding the quote, such as Author, Category and Origin, before saving it to the database.
